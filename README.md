# Mission_to_Mars
The web app created for Robin's Mars research was adjusted to include all four of the hemisphere images. This process included the use of BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
